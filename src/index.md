    <h2 class="section-title">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="section-subtitle">
The W3C Credentials Community Group is dedicated to creating open,
interoperable standards for verifiable credentials and decentralized
identity. We work to establish a decentralized, privacy-preserving ecosystem
where individuals and organizations can securely share and verify credentials
without compromising personal data or relying on centralized authorities.
